This is the repository for a talk I gave at HomeAway on looking at data (cars from UCI ML Repo) and making basic models using R.

Here are the main files of this project and a description of each one:

- FinalReport.pdf: A full report of the whole project I did in MATH 5345 (Regression Analysis) from Texas State University.
- FinalPresentation.pptx: A presentation based on the report (FinalReport.pdf).
- analysis_commented.R: The sourcecode for the analysis, with detailed comments explaining what's going on.
- analysis_no_comments.R: The sourcecode with no comments.

Feel free to clone this repository and play around with it! All you need is an R IDE (I used R Studio). :)
